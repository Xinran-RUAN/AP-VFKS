This is the joint work with Gissell Estrada-Rodriguez and Diane Peurichard. 

By formal arguments, the **diffusion limit** of nonlinear kinetic equations, where both the transport term and the turning operator are **density-dependent**, leads to **volume-exclusion chemotactic (Keller-Segel) equations**. 

We generalise an **asymptotic preserving** scheme for such nonlinear kinetic equations based on a **micro-macro decomposition**. _By properly discretizing the nonlinear term implicitly-explicitly in an **upwind** manner_, the scheme produces accurate approximations also in the case of strong chemosensitivity.

The scheme can be proven to be asymptotic preserving and bound preserving, which are essential for practical applications.
