This is the joint work with Gissell Estrada-Rodriguez and Diane Peurichard. 

By formal arguments, the **diffusion limit** of nonlinear kinetic equations, where both the transport term and the turning operator are **density-dependent**, leads to **volume-exclusion chemotactic (Keller-Segel) equations**. 

We generalise an **asymptotic preserving** scheme for such nonlinear kinetic equations based on a **micro-macro decomposition**. _By properly discretizing the nonlinear term implicitly-explicitly in an **upwind** manner_, the scheme produces accurate approximations also in the case of strong chemosensitivity.

We show, via detailed calculations, that the scheme is asymptotic preserving and bound preserving and show numerically an energy dissipation property, which are essential for practical applications.
